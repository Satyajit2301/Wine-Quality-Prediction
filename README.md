# 🍷 Wine Quality Prediction with Random Forest

This project applies machine learning to predict wine quality using chemical properties such as acidity, alcohol, and pH. A Random Forest Classifier is trained to evaluate the wine and assign a quality score.

## 📌 Project Summary
Using a dataset of red wine samples, we aim to model wine quality as a classification task. The target variable represents quality scores rated by wine tasters, and the goal is to predict these scores based on the wine’s physicochemical composition.

## 🧰 Technologies Used
- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas & NumPy** – data handling
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib** – data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** – model building and evaluation

## 🧪 Dataset Details
The dataset used is the **Red Wine Quality** dataset available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It includes:
- 11 input variables (e.g., fixed acidity, citric acid, alcohol)
- 1 target variable: quality score (integer between 0 and 10)

## 🧠 Model Description
The Random Forest algorithm is chosen due to its robustness and ability to handle non-linear relationships in data. The dataset is split into training and test sets, the model is trained on the training set, and performance is measured on the test set.

## 🧪 Evaluation Metric
- **Accuracy Score**
- Optionally: confusion matrix, feature importance plot (recommended for expansion)
